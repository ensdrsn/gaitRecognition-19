Gait recognition with ConvLSTM

In this work, a novel feature learning method for gait 
recognition is presented. A Convolutional LSTM based gait 
recognition method is studied, with an empirical evaluation in 
terms of pre-processing approaches and network architectures. 
The obtained results demonstrate that by using the discriminative 
power of the deep learning methods, we can achieve good recognition 
results using unsupervised learning. Comprehensive experiments
on theCASIA-B dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method 
for gait recognition.
